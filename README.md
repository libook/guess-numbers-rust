# guess-numbers-rust
A guess numbers game written in Rust.

## How to play

This game will generate 4 non-repeating numbers.

Every time you guess, the game will tell you:
* How many numbers are right and at right positions.
* How many numbers are right but at wrong positions.

## How to build

Just clone the source code and directly run the game with
```bash
cargo run --release
```

Or if you want to build it only
```bash
cargo build --release
```

Then, you can find the executable binary file
 ```bash
 target/release/guess-numbers-rust
 ```

## P.S.

I love this game.
The code could be ugly. Because I'm still learning Rust.
It may be thankful if anybody can give me some advices.
